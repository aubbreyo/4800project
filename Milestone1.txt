User Research

For our user research, we created a simple google form asking a variety of questions relating to self identified negative behavior.  The data collected was from 25 different individuals, all of which were between the ages of 18 - 23, female and male and attended the University of Georgia as undergraduate students.  We did not collect any personally identifiable data due to the sensitive nature of the survey. 

The most important conclusion to be drawn from the user research we conducted, was that every individual reported that they had a self identified negative behavior that they are trying to reduce. Both the type of behavior and length of time exhibiting the behavior was fairly evenly spread amongst the different categories. On average, the self identified negative behavior impacts the individuals daily life at a 6.16 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the least affected and 10 being the most.  In addition, 84% of individuals stated that they have tried, unsuccessfully, to reduce their behavior, through a variety of different methods. Of the methods we listed, 56% of people are attempting to refocus their attention on something else to distract from participating in their behavior.  Lastly, 88% of people communicated that they would be interested in an iOS/Android application that aids in helping to reduce an individuals negative behaviors.  Based on the results of our fsurvey we can conclude that not only does the problem exist but that a large majority of people are already interested in an application to help them reduce their negative behaviors.
